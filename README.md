# Infinite Craft Extensions
See the game here - https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/

A repo to store some extensions I've made to help with some small things while playing.

A lot of them are just personal wants, or things friends have requesteed.

### Requirements

You will need a script browser extension like [TamperMonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) to use these.
After you have one of the extensions, click download and it should auto redirect to install.
